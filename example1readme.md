This Verilog code defines a Finite State Machine (FSM) that detects the occurrence of two consecutive 1s in an input bitstream. 
- Inputs and Outputs
-- clk: The clock signal that drives the FSM.
-- reset: A reset signal that initializes or resets the FSM to its starting state.
-- in_bit: The input bitstream, where the FSM will look for the pattern 11.
-- detected: The output signal that is asserted (set to 1) when the pattern 11 is detected.

- State Encoding
-- The FSM has three states, which are encoded as two-bit values using localparam:
-- S0 (2'b00): The initial state where the FSM waits for the first 1.
-- S1 (2'b01): The state where the FSM has detected the first 1 and is waiting for the second 1.
-- S2 (2'b10): The state where the FSM has detected the sequence 11.
